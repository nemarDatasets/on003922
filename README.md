### DESCRIPTION
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset recorded during the presentation of audiovisual sequences with a causality judgment task and temporal order judgment task. This MEG dataset was prepared in the Brain Imaging Data Structure (MEG-BIDS, Niso et al. 2018) format using MNE-BIDS (Appelhoff et al. 2019).

### PARTICIPANTS
The dataset contains 13 participants (Ab140232, Jl150443, Mm150194, Al150424, Mp110340, Rt160359, Cb140229, Cc160310, Lb160367, Mb160304, Mk150295, Sl160372, Mp150285). 

### EXPERIMENT
The experiment consisted of 10 consecutive recording blocks of 8 minutes each, whose order was counterbalanced across participants. Three blocks tested participants on a Causality judgement, and three blocks tested participants with a Temporal order judgement. Importantly, the same audiovisual sequences were used in both tasks in order to maintain a constant flow of feedforward multisensory inputs while manipulating the endogenous task requirements. Each block was composed of 25 repetitions of the 6 possible audiovisual sequences. A total of 75 presentations of each stimulus sequence were thus tested in each task. Four additional recording blocks consisted of participants passively hearing (auditory localizer, 2 blocks) or viewing (visual localizer, 2 blocks) one constitutive modality of the audiovisual sequence. Each localizer block was composed of 25 repetitions of the 6 possible stimuli (auditory or visual part of each stimuli), yielding a total of 50 presentations of each auditory and visual stimuli (2 tasks x 3 blocks x 25 repetitions x 6 sequences + 2 modalities x 25 repetitions x 2 blocks x 6 sequences = 1500 trials in total). 

### STIMULI
Six audiovisual sequences were presented (DD, DC, CC, AA, AV, VV). 

### BLOCKS
Ten blocks were presented (3 Causality, 3 Temporal, 2 Auditory, 2 Visual).

### MEG
Brain magnetic fields were recorded in a MSR using a 306 MEG system (Neuromag Elekta LTD, Helsinki). MEG recordings were sampled at 1 kHz and band-pass filtered between 0.03 Hz and 330 Hz.

Four head position coils (HPI) measured the head position of participants before each block; three fiducial markers (nasion and pre-auricular points) were used for digitization and anatomicalMRI (aMRI) immediately following MEG acquisition.

Electrooculograms (EOG, horizontal and vertical eye movements) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were simultaneously recorded. Prior to the session, 2 min of empty room recordings was acquired for the computation of the noise covariance matrix.

Bad MEG channels were marked manually.

### MRI
The T1 weighted aMRI was recorded using a 3-T Siemens Trio MRI scanner. Parameters of the sequence were: voxel size: 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.1 mm; acquisition time: 466 s; repetition time TR = 2300 ms; and echo time TE = 2.98 ms
